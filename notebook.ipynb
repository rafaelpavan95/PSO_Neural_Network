    "# Particle Swarm Optimization Based FeedForward Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Evolutionary Computing is an Artificial Intelligence field that focus in algorithms inspired by nature. Such algorithms are used in complex artificial intelligence and optimization problems that cannot be efficiently solved by tradicional mathematical programming methods. In this project, we will create a feedforward neural network that will use the particle swarm optimization algorithm as its optimizer. In order to demonstrate the functionality, the algorithm will be applied in a simple classification problem: Iris (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)\n"

(See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\n",
