# PSO_Neural_Network

Development of a simple FeedForward Neural Network Optimized by Evolutionary Computing (Particle Swarm Optimization). Application on Iris dataset.

--------------------------------

# In this [project](https://github.com/rafaelpavan95/PSO_Neural_Network/blob/main/notebook.ipynb) a simple [feedforward neural network was developed using object oriented programming](https://github.com/rafaelpavan95/PSO_Neural_Network/blob/main/neural.py). In order to optimize the neural network weights I developed a metaheuristic algorithm from the swarm intelligence class ([PSO - Particle Swarm Optimization ](https://github.com/rafaelpavan95/PSO_Neural_Network/blob/main/particle_swarm_optimization.py)). This is an example of evolutionary computing application on machine learning.
